# News Website Layout

This project is meant to highlight some more advanced CSS concepts including; css hamburger menu, calc and custom properties, responsive grids, fonts, tables and forms.

**Note:** A majority of the starting sources and images were taken from Jen Kramer's Frontend Masters Class Repo listed below. We copied the content here to avoid the redundancy.
