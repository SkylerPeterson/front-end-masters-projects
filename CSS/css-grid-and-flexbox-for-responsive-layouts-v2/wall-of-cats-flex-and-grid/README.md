# Grid and Flex Practice
This project is meant to showcase some moderate flexbox and grid usage. The website uses these two design patterns heavily to create a collection of cat pictures. This is following Jen Kramer's "Wall of Wonder" materials which were used in her Frontend Masters course, "CSS Grids and Flexbox in Responsive Web Design v2." This repo simply followed the same instructions but swapped out the images and color pallet for images of our cats.
