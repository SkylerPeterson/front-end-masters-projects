# Front End Masters Projects

This project is just to house all the various small projects or assignments I work on while going through Front End Master classes to improve or learn new skills. Each project will be contained in its own sub directory and will have its own README describing its purpose. This is only meant for learning and does not always represent my true intent for a particular solution.

## Directory Layout

Below is the layout of this package.
